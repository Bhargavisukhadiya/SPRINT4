# SPRINT4
IN THIS SPRINT 4 THE WHOLE PROJECT IS BUILD UP
IN THIS SPRINT I ADDED TWO BUTTON FUNTION ON WORK
GROUP AND UNGROUP
GROUP WORKS TO ATTACH ALL THE SELECTED SHAPE WHEN WE GROUP THE SHAPES WITH THE GROUP BUTTON THEY ALL ATTACH WITH EACH OTHER SO AFTER THAT WHEN WE SELECT ANY OF THE SHAPE ON THE PRESENT SCREEN THAT CONNECT EACH OTHER AND ALL THE SHAPES PRESENT ON THE SCREEN SELECTED AS A RESULT WE CAN SAY THAT ALL THE SHAPES WORK AS A GROUP
UNGROUP IT WORKS AFTER GROUP WHEN WE CLICK UNGROUP THEN ALL THE SHAPES ON THE SCREEN SEPRATES FROM EACH OTHER AND THEN IT WORKS INDIVISUAL NOW WHEN WE SELECT ONE SHAPE IT DIDNOT SELECT ALL THE SHAPE IT JUST SELECT PERTICULAR SHAPE ON WHICH WE WORK
FOR USING GROUP UNGROUP BUTOON WE HHAVE TO USE SELECT METHOD
